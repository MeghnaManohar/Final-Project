# Final-Project: Health App
Description:
Our Health App helps users live a healthier lifestyle! After obtanining information, the app outputs the user's BMI, BMR, and suggested daily calories depending on whether they want to maintain/lose/gain weight. Users can also search for common exercises and see how many calories that activity usually burns. Finally, users can create a menu for the day, by searching for food and we'll catalog how many calories each item of the menu has.

Usage:
Users input their sex, weight, height, age, and activity levels (in metric system or in the imperial system). Our app will then output the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and includes a visual of the ranges of BMI (from underweight to obese). Users will also see their Basal Metabloic Rate (BMR) which helps determine how many calories the user should have daily.  

Notes:
Users' BMR is calculated using the revised Harris-Benedict Equation.
