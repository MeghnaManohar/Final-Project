Description:
Our Health App helps users live a healthier lifestyle! After obtanining information, the app outputs the user's BMI, BMR, and suggested daily calories depending on whether they want to maintain/lose/gain weight. Learn about common excercises and create your own daily menu!


Usage:
Users input their sex, weight, height, age, and activity levels (in metric system or in the imperial system). Our app will then output the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and includes a visual of the ranges of BMI (from underweight to obese). Users will also see their Basal Metabloic Rate (BMR) which helps determine how many calories the user should have daily.  

Users can also search and filter through our common exercises database and see how many calories they'll burn by doing that activity for 1 hour. The table next to it displays calories from one gram (or ounce) of common food groups (like protein, carbs, fats, etc). Users can also sort this table. 

Finally, users can create a menu for the day, by searching for through our food database. After selecting a few tasty items, our program will catalog how many calories each item of the menu has and total it up for the user. 


Notes:
Users' BMR is calculated using the revised Harris-Benedict Equation.
