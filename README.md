# Final-Project: Health App
Description:
Our Health App helps users live a healthier lifestyle! After obtanining information, the app outputs the user's BMI, BMR, and suggested daily calories depending on whether they want to maintain/lose/gain weight. Learn about common excercises and create your own daily menu!




Usage:
Users input their sex, weight, height, age, and activity levels (in metric system or in the imperial system). Our app will then output the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) and includes a visual of the ranges of BMI (from underweight to obese). Users will also see their Basal Metabloic Rate (BMR) which helps determine how many calories the user should have daily.  

Users can also search through our common exercises database and see how many calories that activity usually burns. 

Finally, users can create a menu for the day, by searching for through our food databse. After selecting a few tasty items, our program will catalog how many calories each item of the menu has and total it up for the user. 




Notes:
Users' BMR is calculated using the revised Harris-Benedict Equation.
